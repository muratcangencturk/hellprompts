# HellPrompts

HellPrompts is a small website that serves up creepy and creative prompts for writers and AI enthusiasts. The prompts are stored in `cleaned_prompts.js` and displayed through `index.html`. No build step is required; everything runs in the browser.

## Using Locally

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser. You can doubleâ€‘click the file or serve it via a simple local web server.
3. Click the **Generate Hellprompt** button to create a new random prompt. Click it again any time you want to regenerate a new prompt.

The page will keep a short history of previously generated prompts during your session.

## Regenerating Prompts Data

If you want to change the set of prompts, edit `cleaned_prompts.js` and reload `index.html`. The page will automatically use your updated prompt list.
